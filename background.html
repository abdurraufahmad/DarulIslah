							<div>
								<p>
									Darul Islah Wattarbiyah was established in 2001 to cater for the needs of the growing Muslim community in Burnley.
									The current Muslim population in Burnley is estimated at around 15,000. The Madrasah was initially a church, built in the
									early 1900's. It is made of solid stone and the building itself is a strong building mashaAllah. It consists of a kitchen,
									several classrooms, a library and office, and a prayer hall. The Madrasah was opened on 9th November 2001, in time for
									Ramadhan 2001, where our very first Taraweeh prayers took place at Darul Islah Wattarbiyah. Several people joined in
									the prayers and Salah congregations started taking place.
								</p>

								<p>
									By the grace of Allah Almighty, from these humble beginnings, the congregation has grown and we now have approximately
									200 people offering Jumma salaat and over 200 for Eidain. Our official opening was on 31st December 2001, where Hazrat
									Maulana Yaqub Saheb, Sheikhul Hadith of Darul Kantharia and Maulana Ismail Manubri, Nazim Ala of Ilm Wal Huda Blackburn
									inaugurated the Madrasah.
								</p>

								<p>
									Our focus has since remained upon the evening Madrasah for children, where young children between the ages of 5 and 18
									receive Islamic education in Quranic recitation and Islamic studies. We currently have Nazirah, Hifz, Arabic and Islamic
									studies classes, with a view to begin the full Alim course shortly inshaAllah. All our classes are taught by qualified
									Alims / Alimahs and Huffaz. All Quran recitation is taught with Tajweed. We have a very strong Madrasah curriculum and
									syllabus which is strictly followed by all teachers. We regularly hold parent's evenings and examinations take place on a
									yearly basis. We currently have 14 classes and cater for approximately 300 students, both boys and girls. All girls' classes
									are segregated and take place on the 1st floor, taught by qualified Alimahs. Boy's classes take place on the ground floor,
									taught by qualified Alims and Huffaz. In addition, there is an adult's program on the weekends for males, and weekdays for
									females, where Tajweed and Islamic education is taught. Other efforts, including a daily circle to inspire the qualities of
									Imaan and Salah regularly take place.
								</p>

								<p>
									Darul Islah Wattarbiyah in situated in an ideal location, (on the main road in Burnley) where access is easily available.
									It currently serves a diverse population, with Muslims mainly from the Indian sub-continent.

							<div>
								<p>
									Darul Islah Wattarbiyah, the community, administrators, staff, parents and students work
									together to create an Islamic, physical, emotional, social and safe environment where everyone
									can learn and respect each other. We care about ourselves and others in order to create,
									support and maintain a powerful and engaged learning in the educating of the Holy Quran.
								</p>

								<div class="alert alert-info">
									<p>
										<strong>Darul Islah Wattarbiyah recognises that:</strong>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											each child is an individual and special
										</li>
										<li>
											all children are creative
										</li>
										<li>
											all children need to succeed
										</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<p>
									Therefore Darul Islah Wattarbiyah respects the individual needs of children, fosters a caring and
									creative Islamic environment and emphasises the Islamic social, emotional, physical and intellectual
									development of each child.
								</p>

								<p>
									Darul Islah Wattarbiyah seeks to create an Islamic learning environment that encourages high expectations
									for success through development and appropriate instruction that allows for individual differences and
									learning styles. Our Madrasah promotes a safe, orderly, caring and supportive environment. Each student's self
									esteem is fostered by positive relationships amongst students and staff.
								</p>

								<p>
									We strive to have our parents, teachers and community members actively involved in our student's learning.
									Our mission is to develop young people with active and creative minds, with a sense of understanding, respect
									and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>We stress the total development of each child spiritually, morally and above all, islamically.</strong>
