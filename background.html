					<p>Darul Islah Wattarbiyah was established in 2001 to cater for the needs of the growing Muslim community in Burnley. 
					The current Muslim population in Burnley is estimated at around 15,000. The Madrasah was initially a church, built in the 
					early 1900â€™s. It is made of solid stone and the building itself is a strong building mashaAllah. It consists of a kitchen, 
					several classrooms, a library and office, and a prayer hall. The Madrasah was opened on 9th November 2001, in time for 
					Ramadhan 2001, where our very first Taraweeh prayers took place at Darul Islah Wattarbiyah. Several people joined in 
					the prayers and Salah congregations started taking place.</p>

					<p>By the grace of Allah Almighty, from these humble beginnings, the congregation has grown and we now have approximately 
					200 people offering Jumma salaat and over 200 for Eidain. Our official opening was on 31st December 2001, where Hazrat 
					Maulana Yaqub Saheb, Sheikhul Hadith of Darul Kantharia and Maulana Ismail Manubri, Nazim Ala of Ilm Wal Huda Blackburn 
					inaugurated the Madrasah.</p>

					<p>Our focus has since remained upon the evening Madrasah for children, where young children between the ages of 5 and 18 
					receive Islamic education in Quranic recitation and Islamic studies. We currently have Nazirah, Hifz, Arabic and Islamic 
					studies classes, with a view to begin the full Alim course shortly inshaAllah. All our classes are taught by qualified 
					Alims / Alimahs and Huffaz. All Quran recitation is taught with Tajweed. We have a very strong Madrasah curriculum and 
					syllabus which is strictly followed by all teachers. We regularly hold parent's evenings and examinations take place on a 
					yearly basis. We currently have 14 classes and cater for approximately 300 students, both boys and girls. All girls' classes 
					are segregated and take place on the 1st floor, taught by qualified Alimahs. Boy's classes take place on the ground floor, 
					taught by qualified Alims and Huffaz. In addition, there is an adult's program on the weekends for males, and weekdays for 
					females, where Tajweed and Islamic education is taught. Other efforts, including a daily circle to inspire the qualities of 
					Imaan and Salah regularly take place.</p>

					<p>Darul Islah Wattarbiyah in situated in an ideal location, (on the main road in Burnley) where access is easily available. 	
					It currently serves a diverse population, with Muslims mainly from the Indian sub-continent.</p>
