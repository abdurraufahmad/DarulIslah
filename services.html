										<h4 class="tile-title">Marriage Services</h4>
										
										<p>
											Nikah (marriage) completes a person's Imaan (faith). It keeps an individual away from sin, and brings peace and tranquilly to oneâ€™s life.
											Our Prophet (peace be upon him) has instructed us to look for â€˜pietyâ€™ when seeking a partner. In addition to this, there must also be compatibility.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											In Islam Nikah is a very simple and straightforward affair. The bride and bridegroom have to accept each other as husband and wife in front 
											of two male witnesses. It was the practice of our beloved prophet (SAW) to recite a sermon prior to the Nikah. Hence, a sermon is read before a Nikah is conducted.
										</p>

										<h4 class="break">The Service</h4>

										<p> 
											Nikahs are conducted on our premises, or at another location if required.
											You will require a "Wakeel" (Bride's representative) if the bride is not going to be present when the Nikah is conducted. This "Wakeel" will have obtained permission from the bride.
											The "Wakeel" is usually the father, uncle, eldest brother etc. However it can be any individual, such as a family friend.
										</p>	
											
										<p>
											If the bride is going to be present at the Nikah ceremony, then only two witnesses are required.
											Both the bride and bridegroom should educate themselves with their respective responsibilities.
										</p>

										<p> 
											Currently, Maulana Abdul Razzaq and/or Maulana Firasat conduct all Nikahs.
										</p>


										<h4 class="break">The Ceremony</h4>

										<div>
											<p>
												The Imaam (the conducting the Nikah) will recite a short Khutba (sermon) in Arabic. This sermon consists of:
											</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Praise to Allah.</li>
												<li>Salutations on our final Prophet (peace be upon him) and all prophets.</li>
												<li>Repentance and other supplications.</li>
												<li>Testimony to the fact there is ONLY one God (Allah).</li>
												<li>Quran verses, that preach about piety and the fear of Allah.</li>
												<li>Certain Ahaadith, sayings of our Prophet (peace be upon him) on Nikah.</li>
											</ol>		
										
											<p>
												Imam will then:
											</p>
										
											<ol>
												<li>Ask the Wakeel (or the bride if present) their consent.</li>
												<li>The Imam will then ask the bridegroom if he has accepted the bride in Nikah.</li>
												<li>The 2 witnesses will be witness to this Nikah ceremony.</li>
												<li>If the Mahr (dowry) has been fixed, it will also be mentioned.</li>
											</ol>
										</div>
										
										<p>The Nikah is now complete.</p>
										<p>A Dua (supplication) will then be made to end the ceremony.</p>

										<h4 class="tile-title">Funeral Services</h4>
	
										<p>
											Death is a very painful and emotional time, yet one that may be filled with hope and mercy. Muslims believe that death is a departure from the life of this world, but not the end of a person's existence. Rather, eternal life is to come, and we pray for Allah's (swt) mercy to be with the departed, in hopes that they may find peace and happiness in the life to come.
										</p>
										<p>	
											When a Muslim is near death, those around him or her are called upon to give comfort, and reminders of Allah's (swt) mercy and forgiveness. They may recite verses from the Qur'an, give physical comfort, and encourage the dying one to recite words of remembrance and prayer.
										</p>

										<h4 class="break">The Service</h4>

										<p>
											When a loss in the family occurs and funeral services are required, our Masjid is here to help you. You may contact our Imams for these services once the attending doctor of the deceased or a coroner has issued a death certificate and the body is officially ready for release.
										</p>

										<p>
											At Darul Islah, we have our own 'unique washroom facilty' which has been designed for the deceased only.
										</p>

										<p>										
											Funeral Services that Darul Islah currently offer include:
										</p>
										
										<div>
											<ol>

												<li>Janazah Prayer of the Mayat</li>
